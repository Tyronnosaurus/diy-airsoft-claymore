Make PIR holder stronger, reduce size of PIR hole

Save servo state on EEPROM (currently it always goes to Closed position during startup)

Go to sleep during PIR calibration

Turn off Brown-out detection?


--------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE:

Do not use VT pin on the RF receiver
PIR interrupt only when armed
Put RF receiver below
Add logo
Add resistor to Servo power pin --> SMD or through hole?     MAX SMD Power = 0.125 W      http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-sizes-and-packages/
Lay down capacitors
Holes for the pushbutton
Add ground plane
Check for traces at 90º
Correct pad sizes
Check traces' width


DISCARDED:

Control power to RF receiver
Add Serial
Connect mounting holes to ground
When armed, pressing button should not trigger explosion
Integrate header for extra trigger on the same pin as the pushbutton
